Arduino and Raspberry Pi Source Code for Bee Hive Temperature Monitoring Project http://beemonitor.org/setup

# Update June 2016

**Software has been tweaked, re-compiled and refactored, see the new repository for latest code:**

***

* **Arduino Tx** - read from DS18B20 temperature sensors every 60's, read battey voltage and and tramsmitt via RF. Atmega328 is put to sleep in between readings to save battery power 

* **Arduino Rx** - Receive data via RF, decod and print to serial - Arduino connected to web-connected Raspberry Pi via USB serial 


* Raspberry Pi uses emonHub serial listener to receive data via USB serial port (/dev/ttyUSB0) and post to https://emoncms.org for loggin and graphing
